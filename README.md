Best Friday Night Project

Welcome to our project! It was a scrambled effort to put this project together, but we were able to find some great analyses from these datasets and make them our own. Originally, this was a 5 member project, but we were able to make it through with just the 2 of us! This project is mainly to practice the skills we learned for data analytics, so we used various tools like Python, matplotlib, jupyter notebook, pandas, vscode, and more! 

For the project itself, we decided to combine two topics that we liked, and that was weed usage and healthier fast food options. We put everything together into a jupyter notebook and showcased all the skills we have developed so far. We gathered these datasets, cleaned them, and found ways to analyze them in a meaningful way. We created various tables and graphs to help organize our findings and to emphasize our analysis even further. If you look into our jupyter notebook, you will find our chosen analysis and concluding ideas for each topic. 

We hope that our project is insightful and allows others to see different methods of data cleaning and data analytics. 

Thank you.
